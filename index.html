            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
              I am a graduate of the University of Ibadan and completed my national service year in 2024, where I worked as a teacher. 
              During my time at the university I started learning how websites were built, and over time, I realised I loved bringing ideas to life through code. <br /> <br />
              During my NYSC year, I taught in a school and used my free time to deepen my web development skills. 
              Frontend engineering felt like the perfect match for me - it let me mix creativity with logic, visuals with structure.

            <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>
            <p>
              I just didn't want to learn in isolation, I wanted to be part of a group of people working towards a similar goal, sharing feedback and pushing each other to get better.
              AltSchool feels like the right place to turn my interest in frontend engineering into something solid - a real career path.

            <h2>My Goals in the Program</h2>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  My main goal in the program is to become a confident and skilled frontend engineer who can build real, user-friendly web applications.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I want to master the tools and technologies used in the industry, like HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and TypeScript, and understand how they all work together to create smooth and responsive websites.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I also want to get better at solving problems, writing clean code, and working teams.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I am also focused on building a strong portfolio that shows what I can do and tells the story of my growth.
                </li>
                <li>
                  By the end of the program, I want to feel ready to take on internships or junior developer roles, not just with head knowledge but with the confidence that I can deliver real value wherever I work.
                </li>
